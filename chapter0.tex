\begin{acknowledgment}

This work could not have been accomplished isolation. I am greatly thankful for the countless hours of mentorship, encouragement, and inspiration provided by Rachel Karchin. I also appreciate the valuable advice provided by Noushin Niknafs, Chris Douville, and Violeta Beleva-Guthrie, especially when I just started in the lab. My lively experiences in the lab also would not have been the same without Rohit Bhattacharya, Ashok Sivakumar, Lily Zheng, and Melody Shao.

I would also like to thank collaborators who were essential in my projects. Bert Vogelstein's insights into cancer drivers were critical for formulating 20/20+. The CHASMplus analysis would not be the same without Nick Roberts and Neha Nanda experimental perspective on ATM. I especially thank Matthew Bailey and Eduard Porta-Pardo for their creativity, insights, enthusiasm, and camaraderie when analyzing drivers in the driver's group of The Cancer Genome Atlas.
